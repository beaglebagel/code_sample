Instruction to run the program: (Python 3.6 required)
    1. Go to directory where fund.py file is placed.
    2. Run chmod a+x fund.py
    3. Run ./fund.py -d {full path to input directory}

Follow up questions
1. 5 hours. Finalizing data model/relationship management was most difficult part overall as it affects overall complexity
especially around loan assignment part.

2. My initial Covenant implementation doesn't separate maximum default likelihood & banned states.
I would introduce type abstraction to Covenant class that will provide functional unit of check(pass/fail) logic per covenant type.
This should allow easier maintenance of various covenants types that might come in the future.

3. New Facilities can be set to be controlled from high level service(Desktop/Web).
Each facilities shall maintain states like assigned loans, associated covenants.
CSV of facilities can be uploaded through interface with input valoan_idation.

4. REST - Creating & Assigning loan can roughly use below calls together internally.
    - Post /loan /facility : create loan, facility.
    - Get /facilities or /facility/{facility_id}: get all or specific facility info.
    - Get /loans or /loan/{loan_id}: get all or specific loan info.
    - Get /covenants or /covenant/{covenant_id}: get all or specific covenant info.
    - Get /banks or /{bank_id}: get all or specific bank info.
    - Put /loan/{loan_id} /facility/{facility_id} : update specific loan or facility.
    - Put /facility/{facility_id}/loan/{loan_id} : assign a loan to facility.
    - Delete /facility/{facility_id}/loan/{loan_id} : unassign a loan from facility.

5. Other heuristics that could be combination of..
    - Combining size(higher the better) & interest(lower the better) rate factor to find fulfilling facility.

6. Complexity Analysis
 - Load Facility(N): Run: O(N), Space: O(N)
 - Load Covenant(N): Run: O(N), Space: O(N)
 - Load Loan(N): Run: O(N), Space: O(N)
 - Process Covenant(N): Run: O(N), Space: O(N)
 - Heapify Facility(N): Run: O(N)
 - Process Loan(N), Facility(F)
    - Find Facility:
        - Run: O(FlgF) as worst case as each loan can potentailly exhauste entire heap not finding any matches.
    - Overall Run: O(NFlgF), Space: O(N) + O(F)
 - Write(N): Run: O(N)
